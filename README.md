# ez-uploader.de
An Image/Text upload service which provides a bunch of extras and should integrate with ShareX


Database
======
![This is the basic DB modeling.](https://images.jodu555.de/a8f84d75882aa6892e86eeb725f2b0cc.png "This is the db model till now.")


## Basic Thoughts
### This Application is:	
-	Image Uploader
-	Text Uploader
-	Sharing all those uploaded works
-	Make them public/private or define who can see or edit the entry's

### This Application is not:
-	A Highly influenced file store like Dropbox
-	An Application that could handle more than 1k users
-	A General file store with files over 1gig

### Why Iâ€™d choose to build this Application:
This System is for me more a learning thing than a high industry standard app!\
I want to test e.g the hierarchical folder structure and how to represent them in code or implement them in the database \
I want to learn how to work with these types of sharing things\
I want to learn how generally a public application like this is structured also with where the files are stored\

## Todo
*	[ ]  Entry: Image / Text: An Entry is just my naming representation for this system
*	[ ] Multiple Accounts System
*	[ ] Image-Uploader (SahreX Integration)
*	[ ] Text-Uploader (ShareX Integration)
*	[ ] An ability to create folders with hierarchical structures: To sort the entries
*	[ ] A Permission system to clarify if an Entry is password protected or just unlisted
*	[ ] An Global Permission system to allow an account to choose which user can see their pictures
*	[ ] Sorting System Day/Month/Year
*	[ ] Public page for any user to show their published entries
